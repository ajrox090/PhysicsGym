Improvements:
    
    * Start each section, of atleast 2 pages, with an introduction paragraph that summarizes what was discussed previously and what is happening next

    * Algorithm for introduction:
        - write each subsection yourself as much as you can about the topic.
        - calculate error:
                J := min [actual page count - expected page count]
        - optimal solution

Abstract         (1p)

1) Introduction     (2p)   (formal in a philosophical way)
    1.1) pde control    (1/2)
        1.2.1) what is pde control and why is it relevant?
        1.2.2) some applications of pde control for chaotic systems[Kuramoto Sivashinsky] and complex fluid systems[Cylinder2DFlowDRL] such as HVAC [HeatInvader]
    1.2) mpc    (1/2)
        1.2.1) what is mpc and its success stories
        1.2.2) why does mpc work and its limitations
    1.3) rl     (1/2)
        1.3.1) what is RL and its success stories
        1.3.2) why does RL work and its limitations
    1.4) thesis (1/2)
        1.4.1) describe the current usage of rl in the `pde control` field and motivate the need for  an interface.
        1.4.2) my main contributions with this thesis:
            1) interface (physics and environment interface)
                - how did I design the interface, what considerations did we take into account?
            2) what can the interface be used for ?
                - and what not?
        1.4.3) how is the rest of the thesis arranged?

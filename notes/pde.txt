PDE (3p) [currently: 2p]

Partial differential equations (PDE) are used to mathematically formulate laws of physics that involve multiple variables. They are used to describe physical phenomenas like flow of fluid inside a cylinder, heat dissipation, propagation of sound waves, electrodynamics, etc. Technically speaking the three main components forming a PDE are multiple independent variables, an unknown function of these variables and the partial derivatives of this function. Before diving into PDE, lets understand a more simple form of differential equations called Ordinary differential equations (ODE) that are made up of only a single independent variable. It also consists of an unknown function and its partial derivatives that describes the change in a physical quantity with respect to time.

ODEs can be used to model some interesting physical phenomena like movement of electricity, to and fro motion of a pendulum, and various concepts related to exchange of energy in a simple system. A simple ODE is given by dy/dt = ky; where k is a constant and y is the independent variable. The solution to this ode can be given by y(t) = C e^(kt) where C is a constant. This solution represents exponential growth and decay for k>0 and k<0 respectively. Another simple ode representing wave propagation with a degree of 2 is given by: d2y/dt3 + W2y = 0; w represents the constant frequency of oscilation of particles forming the wave. A solution to this ODE can be given by: y(t) = A sin(wt + O/); Here, A is the amplitude of the wave and O/ is the phase. This ODE represents a simple harmonic motion of a particle exhibiting periodic behavior in time.

Although ODEs are useful for modeling many simple physical phenomena, when it comes to complex systems, it is not enough to represent a physical system by using just a single variable. For such purposes, partial differential equations compe into play. As described earlier, PDEs consists of two or more variables used to model more complex physical systems. One such example is a convection-diffusion equation  /equation/.  Here, u is the independent variable which represents velocity of fluid, or temperature in a heat transfer system. D is the diffusivity constant e.g. diffusivity of a particle in motion, thermal diffusivity or viscosity in terms of fluid flow and v is the velocity of particle w.r.t time. When the diffusivity represents the viscosity of fluid, the above equation becomes viscous burgers equaiton which represents velocity of particle at each point in time using a convection-diffusion mechanicsm.

We now formulate partial differential equations as physical models as described in the book, "Physics based deep learning"[]. In this thesis, we mainly focus on continuous PDEs say P*. The solution of P* lies in the spatial domain /equation/ in d 1,2,3 dimensions. This domain would present a 3d room in case of heat transfer system or a 3d cylinder in case of fluid flow system. The independent variables could be either scalar or vector fields e.g. the pressure can be presented by a scalar field p:RXR->R where as the velocity of a particle at each point in time for a given space is a d-dimensional vector field given by u:R X R -> R. A 3d vector will be represented as u = (ux,uy,uz) where x,y,z->O. In the book [], they have used numerical methods to discretize this continuous pde and then step the pde forward in time with time steps of ^t. We will consider the solution as expressed in the book, u(x,t+^t) = P(ux,uxx,uxxx...x) where ux denotes the spatial derivatives du(x,t)/dx.

Solving:The most intutive method for solving PDe is the so called Analytical method: where solution is extracted by changes to already available solutions eg. one such method is spatial? partial differential solver that separates the multiple independent variables in a PDE into individual functions where each function is an ODE. why analytical methods dont work?
Numerical method: Another famous method is that of numerically finding solutions to pde. The most common technique in numerical methods is Finite Elements method that basically dicretizes continuous pdes into finite timesteps and solves them explicitly for this time duration.Talk about Finite elements method:
 Next we will discuss some interesting PDEs along with their visualization and some relevant problems.

Examples:Some examples of pdes are burgers equation, heat equation, kuramoto sivashinsky equation and navier stokes.
1) Burgers equation: is a simple advection diffusion equation where the advection terms represent the motion of each particle in the field and the diffusion term, the dissipation due to the second law of thermodynamics. \Equations1. Here, v represents the viscosity of the fluid and g denotes the external forces applied. For an inviscous fluid, this equation simplifies to \Equations2.
2) Heat eqution: is a simple diffusion equation that helps model how the heat transfer occurs between from the area that is hot to the area that is cold. It does so by explicity diffusing heat and is given by \Equations.
3) Kuramoto Sivashinsky: is a fourth order convection-diffusion equation that helps model physical phenoma like flame fronts, fluid flow and more. One property of KS equation is that with the increase in domain complexity, the stability of system decreases.
4) Navier stokes: Navier stokes is one of the biggest equation modeling fluid flow in Physics. It uses velocity of fluid and pressure as parameter and show the change in these quantities in the presence of a force. This equation is in particularly used for control applications related to fluid flow problems like drag reduction and lift reduction.

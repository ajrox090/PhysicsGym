3.0) Introduction
    - what are partial differential equations?
    Partial differential equations are mathematical tools for formulating laws of physics representing complex dynamical systems involving more than one variables.

    - what are they used for?
    They are used to model equations describing  physical phenomena like flow of fluid inside a cylinder given by Navier Stokes equation[], propagation of sound waves given by the wave equation[], dissipation of heat, electrodynamics, etc. 

    - components of PDE
    In general a partial differential equation consists of i) one or more independent variables, which represent the physical quantity of system like velocity or temperature of a particle, ii) an unknown smooth and continuous function of those variables and iii) the partial derivatives of this function. The order of a partial differential equation represents the highest derivative of the unknown function
    
    - example + explanation of each component including (laplacian operators)
    Consider a simple linear parabolic partial differential equation known as heat equation
    $u_t - u_{xx} = 0$
    here, u is the unknown function and uxx represents the second order derivative of u.


    - what are ordinary differential equations?
    Before diving into PDE, lets understand a more simple form of differential equations called Ordinary differential equations (ODE) consisting of only a single independent variable. It also consists of an unknown function and its partial derivatives that describes the change in a physical quantity with respect to time. ODEs can be used to model some interesting physical phenomena like movement of electricity, to and fro motion of a pendulum, and various concepts related to exchange of energy in a simple system. 
    
    - some examples
    A simple ODE is given by $dy/dt = ky$; where $k$ is a constant and y is the independent variable. The solution to this ode can be given by $y(t) = C e^{(kt)}$ where $C$ is a constant. This solution represents exponential growth and decay for $k>0$ and $k<0$ respectively. Another simple ode representing wave propagation with a degree of 2 is given by $d^2y/dt^2 + W^2y = 0$; here w represents the constant frequency of oscillation of particles forming the wave. A solution to this ODE can be given by $y(t) = A sin(wt + O/)$ where, A is the amplitude of the wave and $O/$ is the phase. This ODE represents a simple harmonic motion of a particle exhibiting periodic behavior in time.

    - limitations of ode
    Although ODEs are useful for modeling many simple physical phenomena, when it comes to complex systems, it is not enough to represent a physical system by using just a single variable.

    - convection diffusion equation
    For such purposes, partial differential equations come into play. As described earlier, PDEs consists of two or more variables used to model more complex physical systems. One such example is a convection-diffusion equation,
    \begin{equation*}
        \pdv{u(x,t)}{t} = D \cdot \pdv[2]{u(x,t)}{x} - u(x,t) \cdot \pdv{u(x,t)}{x} 
    \end{equation*}
    Here, u is the independent variable which represents velocity of fluid, or temperature in a heat transfer system. D is the diffusivity constant e.g. diffusivity of a particle in motion, thermal diffusivity or viscosity in terms of fluid flow and v is the velocity of particle w.r.t time. When the diffusivity represents the viscosity of fluid, the above equation becomes viscous burgers equation which represents velocity of particle at each point in time using a convection-diffusion mechanism.

    - what are boundary constraints?
    Differential equations can have infinitely many solutions. For example, consider the equation of curve $\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2$, with a general solution of $y = \frac{x^3}{3} + c$ where c is some arbitrary constant. Here, infinite solutions exist because c can be any integer. In order to get a unique solution, external constraints need to be imposed which involves specifying bounds to the domain of solutions. For the above example, we only consider the curve that goes through point $(x,y) = (0,1)$, then the only solution that satisfies this condition is with $c=1$, $y = \frac{x^3}{3} + 1$. For initial value problems[], these constraints require specifying only the initial value of the unknown function while for Boundary value problems require conditions for each boundary in the domain. In this thesis we will focus on boundary value problems and there are three types of boundary conditions normally encountered in the solution of partial differential equations namely, Dirichlet boundary conditions, Neumann boundary conditions and Robin boundary conditions.

    - Dirichlet and Neumann constraints
    Dirichlet boundary condition, aka. first-type boundary condition specifies the values that an unknown function needs to take on along the boundary of the domain. E.g. talking about heat diffusion in a room, if the temperature at walls is specified by a function $f$, this implies Dirichlet boundary conditions and if the temperature is sepcificed by the normal derivative of the function on a surface, its called Neuamann boundary condition.

Partial differential equations (PDE) are used to mathematically formulate laws of physics that involve multiple variables. They are used to describe physical phenomena like flow of fluid inside a cylinder, heat dissipation, propagation of sound waves, electrodynamics, etc. Technically speaking the three main components forming a PDE are multiple independent variables, an unknown function of these variables and the partial derivatives of this function. Before diving into PDE, lets understand a more simple form of differential equations called Ordinary differential equations (ODE) that are made up of only a single independent variable. It also consists of an unknown function and its partial derivatives that describes the change in a physical quantity with respect to time.

ODEs can be used to model some interesting physical phenomena like movement of electricity, to and fro motion of a pendulum, and various concepts related to exchange of energy in a simple system. A simple ODE is given by dy/dt = ky; where k is a constant and y is the independent variable. The solution to this ode can be given by y(t) = C e^(kt) where C is a constant. This solution represents exponential growth and decay for k>0 and k<0 respectively. Another simple ode representing wave propagation with a degree of 2 is given by: d2y/dt3 + W2y = 0; w represents the constant frequency of oscilation of particles forming the wave. A solution to this ODE can be given by: y(t) = A sin(wt + O/); Here, A is the amplitude of the wave and O/ is the phase. This ODE represents a simple harmonic motion of a particle exhibiting periodic behavior in time.

Although ODEs are useful for modeling many simple physical phenomena, when it comes to complex systems, it is not enough to represent a physical system by using just a single variable. For such purposes, partial differential equations compe into play. As described earlier, PDEs consists of two or more variables used to model more complex physical systems. One such example is a convection-diffusion equation  /equation/.  Here, u is the independent variable which represents velocity of fluid, or temperature in a heat transfer system. D is the diffusivity constant e.g. diffusivity of a particle in motion, thermal diffusivity or viscosity in terms of fluid flow and v is the velocity of particle w.r.t time. When the diffusivity represents the viscosity of fluid, the above equation becomes viscous burgers equaiton which represents velocity of particle at each point in time using a convection-diffusion mechanicsm.

We now formulate partial differential equations as physical models as described in the book, "Physics based deep learning"[]. In this thesis, we mainly focus on continuous PDEs say P*. The solution of P* lies in the spatial domain /equation/ in d 1,2,3 dimensions. This domain could present a 3d room in case of heat transfer system or a 3d cylinder in case of fluid flow system. The independent variables could be either scalar or vector fields e.g. the pressure can be presented by a scalar field p:RXR->R where as the velocity of a particle at each point in time for a given space is a d-dimensional vector field given by u:R X R -> R. A 3d vector will be represented as u = (ux,uy,uz) where x,y,z->O. In the book [], they have used numerical methods to discretize this continuous pde and then step the pde forward in time with time steps of ^t. We will consider the solution as expressed in the book, u(x,t+^t) = P(ux,uxx,uxxx...x) where ux denotes the spatial derivatives du(x,t)/dx.

Solving PDEs
There are two well known methods for solving pde, analytical methods and numerical methods. In general analytical solutions for a pde problem are exact solutions while numerical solutions are finite approximations. An analytical solution involves well-formed understanding of a problem to calculate this exact solution. For example, consider a pde that can be represented as a linear mapping for multiple odes for which an exact solution is known, an analytical soultion could involve solving these individual odes and then averaging each solution. However, such a solution requires  complete knowledge of how the problem works which is impossible for many continuous problems. Hence, comes numerical solutions to the rescue. Roughly speaking numerical solutions involve framing the problem and using trial and error across a set of candidate solutions [pl*]. This gives satisfactory results especially because often times we are concerned with an approximately good solution rather than an exact solution. There are many numerical methods for solving a pde, viz Finite element method, finite differences method, finite volume, etc. All these methods use discretization to approximate solution to PDE which involves evolving a discrete set of values and by taking small steps in time to approximate the continuous function of space and time[\refx].

Finite Difference Method
Finite difference methods are numerical methods for approximating solutions to a PDE by approximating derivatives with finite differences. For example, consider an ordinary differential equation of the form:
\equation in my book
The Euler's method for solving this equation is given by
\equation in my book
where t(x + h) is the finite difference term. Substituting the value of t'(x) from ODE, we get,
\derivation equation

This constitutes the finite difference equation for this ODE and solving this equation, gives an approximate solution to this equation. The finite difference method is well formulated in the chapter 20 of the book "Numerical methods for Engineers". Here we will only briefly explain this method using an example from the book for laplace equation. For more equations like other elliptic or parabolic equations, please refer to chapters 29 and 30 of the book.

To understand how the finite difference method works in more detail, we consider the simple laplace equation which can be used to model a variety of problems involving the potential of an unknown variable[\a]. The second-order linear laplace equation is given by
\equation from my book

Consider a square grid as the domain, (del i,j)* where i,j represents points in x and y direction of domain respectively. the centeral differences are given by
\equation from my book
\equation from my book
Since the grid is square, (x = y)*, the laplace difference equation becomes,
\equation from my book
In order to obtain the exact solution of any PDE, the boundary conditions need to be specified. Consider the dirichlet boundary conditions, which basically means setting each boundary of the grid to some constant value as shown in the figurex, Now solving for i=1,j=1, we get,
\equation from my book
We know from the boundary conditions that t01 = 75, t10 = 0, substituting this we get,
\equation from my book
Similarly rest of the equations can be calculated for other values of i,j in the grid and solving these equations will give the approximate solution using finite difference method. Also, since the grid is quite small, it is possible to calculate the equations by hand but in practice, there is a method called "The Liebman method" that is used for calculation of complex grids. (refer to chapter 29 of book [] for more detail).

The finite differences method introduced before doesn't work well for irregular geometry, complex boundary conditions or for heterogenous compositions[]. For this, the alternative is finite element method which first divides the solution domain into elements which are simpler in shape and then finds an approximate solution for each element function thereby assembling them into a unified solution. As in the previous method, we provide a brief description of steps involved in solving a PDE with finite element method. For more thorough explanation one may refer to chapter 31 of the book "Numerical methods for engineers"

Finite Elements Method
The general implementation of finite element method consists of 5 main steps: discretization, element equations, assembly, boundary conditions and solution. The discretization step invovles dividing the domain into finite number of elements e.g.
For one dimensional domain, a line, the division can be done by divding the line using finite number of points on the line. For two dimensional, one can use traingualr elements or quadrilateral elements and for three dimensional, a plane of a hexahedron shape can be used for discretizing the domain. The second step is to develop differential equations for each discretized elements. This consists of two steps. First, step invovles choice of approximate functions a.k.a. basis functions that is used for approximating the individual elements. For example, consider the following equation of line[],
\equation

where u(x) is the dependent variable, a0 and a1 are the constants and x is the independent variable. Here, the dependent variable can be written as a linear combination of approximate functions as follows,
u = N1u1 + N2u2
where u1 and u2 are the approximate functions with,
\equation
The next step is to find the right value for quoeficients that can help solve the problem optimally which involves methods like variational approach and the method of weighing residuals[b]. Once the individual element functions are developed, they are assembled in the next step which invovles combining all the individual element equations into one unified equation that represents the entire system. Then, the boundary conditions are applied on this unified system before finally solving the system using methods like LU decomposition.[b]

Next we will discuss 4 PDEs, burgers euqation for fluid flow, heat equation for temperature change, Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation for flame.





PDE Examples
Burgers Equation is one of the simplest PDEs describing the velocity of fluid with respect to time and is given by,
\equation
where u is the velocity field and v is the viscosity of fluid. When viscosity is 0, this equation simplifies to inviscous burgers equation which is a prototype for equations that develop shockwaves.
\equation
It is also called a convection-diffusion equation because the quantities x and y represent the convection term and diffusion term respectively.

Next we visualise the time evolution of burgers equation. For this, we consider a 1-dimensional domain OcR of sie 128, viscosity of 0.29 and the initial condition given by u(x,0) = f(x) where f is a guassian function. For boundary conditions, we will use dirichlet condition which sets the velocity at boundaries to 0. 
Fig1 shows the time evolution of initial w.r.t. velocity for a time period of t=0,1/3,2/3,1. Observing the lines for each timestep, all the positive values tend to move towards right and the negative values towards left of the grid. This is because the differential of function is proportional to u [dont understand] in equation 1. These two trends moving inwards from opposite direction creates a shockwave approximately in the center of the grid. Fig2, shows the spatial evolution of velocity with respect to time and also captures the generation of shockwaves. 

PDE control applications:There are some control applications where an external force is applied on this system governed by burgers equation with a goal to dampen shockwaves(ref)
















Heat Equation
The heat equation is a simple diffusion equation that calculates the change in the temperature at each point in space for that particular time and is given by,
\equation
Here, u is the temperature at each point x in space at time t, D is the diffusivity constant that defines the rate at which the exchange of heat occurs in the field and the final second order differential is the diffusion term.

Consider a simulation of heat transfer in a pre-heated rod. We assume that the rod is insulated i.e. there is no exchange of heat between the rod and the environment from outside of the rod and the two ends of rod are at a constant temperature of 0 degrees. Now we know from the law of conservation of energy that the exchange of heat occurs from hotter areas to colder areas untill the temperature is constant at every point in the field. Fig1 and 2, showcase this phenomena. Fig1, shows the simulation of heat transfer inside the rod for a finite number of steps. It is evident from the line plot that the local maximas move downwards towards 0 as they are at higher temperature than their neighbors while the local minimas move upwards towards 0, both stabilizing near 0. Fig2 shows this evolution w.r.t. spaec and time. This plot also shows the diffusion between hotter areas inside the rod in yellow and the colder areas in blue as the time passes.

Considering the control problems involving heat equation, this equation is sometimes used in conjunction with other equations in an application. For example, if we are talking about controlling the temperature of a room with a fan, the airflow from a fan can be calculated by Navier Stokes equation or Burgers equation and the temperature change is calculated with heat equation.
















Kuramoto Sivashinsky: is a fourth order convection-diffusion equation that helps model physical phenoma like flame fronts, fluid flow and more. One property of KS equation is that with the increase in domain complexity, the stability of system decreases.
4) Navier stokes: Navier stokes is one of the biggest equation modeling fluid flow in Physics. It uses velocity of fluid and pressure as parameter and show the change in these quantities in the presence of a force. This equation is in particularly used for control applications related to fluid flow problems like drag reduction and lift reduction.

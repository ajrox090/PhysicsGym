Burgers equation (3p)
    - Introduction
        Burgers equation is one of the simplest PDEs that describes speed of fluid with respect to time and is given by
        d/dt u(x,t) = - u(x,t) * d/dx u(x,t) + v * d2/dx2 u(x,t) + F(x,t)
        Here, u is the velocity field, v is the viscosity of fluid and F is the optional control force.  This viscous
        burgers equation calculates the change in velocity u(x,t) of a viscous fluid in the presence of an external
        force. This equation further simplifies to inviscous burgers equation in the presence of inviscous fluid, also
        used for prototyping equations causing shock-waves in solution.
        d/dt u(x,t) + u(x,t) * d/dx u(x,t) = 0

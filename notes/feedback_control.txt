Feedback Control:


Many real world physics problems can be formulated using PDEs representing the physical models like controlling drag generated by two jets in a cylinder. In terms of PDe, control is possilbe by dynamic actuation of forces and evaluating the change in the environment by solving these pde. This is the very basis of feedback control

Openloop-vs closedloop systems:

Feedback control system: A system in which the output consitutes as feedback to reach certain control goal is a feedback control system.

Conventional approaches to feedback control: PID

Iterative methods: MPC


ML methods: Supervised learning, RL
